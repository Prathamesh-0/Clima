// LocationScreen is a stateful widget. LocationScreenState is a state of the LocationScreen widget(since this is a stateful widget, this cave many widgets)
// Every state has a "widget" property jiske madat se apan uske parent wale stateful widget me present chiizo ko access kr skte hai.
// uske parent wale stateful widget means the stateful widget of which this state is a state.

// We have to get data from the screen object (the data which was passed from one screen to other) to its state object.
// Note that the location screen's stateful widget is actually a separate object from it's state.
// location screen and the state object are different.
// The location screen object and the location screen's state object are linked. In other words, the state object knows which stateful widget it belongs to.
// The state object has a property called "widget", which will point to it's parent stateful widget.

// You get access to the "widget" object inside every single state object. It is the current object's configuration.
// You get access to the "widget" object inside every single state object. It is the current object's configuration.
// A [State] object's configuration is the corresponding [StatefulWidget] instance.
